NOW THAT YOU ARE MY
BRIDE, YOU WILL NEVER
LEAVE THIS CASTLE!
WOW! YOUR
LIBRARY IS
AMAZING!
BEYOND THE CASTLE IS
A HIGH WALL WITH NO
GATE, AND BEYOND THAT
IS A DEEP, DARK FOREST
WITH NO PATH.
I SUPPOSE IT´S
MY LIBRARY TOO,
NOW WE‛ RE
MARRIED.
THE FOREST IS CRAWLING
WITH RAVENOUS WOLVES,
MALIGNANT BIRDS AND
THE SPIRITS OF LONG-
DEAD TRAVELLERS.
SO MANY BOOKS!
I CAN´T BELIEVE
MY LUCK!
WHEN THE SUN SETS,
I TRANSFORM INTO A WILD
BEAST AND SOAR INTO
THE NIGHT, SEIZED BY
A TERRIBLE BLOODLUST!
OK. I´LL STAY
HERE AND READ.
SEE YOU IN THE
MORNING.
