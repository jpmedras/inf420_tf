A Teen’s View of Social Media
Instagram is made up of all photos and videos. There
is the home page that showcases the posts from people
you follow, an explore tab which offers posts from accounts
all over the world, and your own page, with a notification
tab to show who likes and comments on your posts.
It has some downsides though. It is known to make
many people feel insecure or down about themselves
because the platform showcases the highlights of
everyone’s lives, while rarely showing the negatives.
This can make one feel like their life is not going as well
as others, contributing to the growing rates of anxiety or
depression in many teens today. There is an underlying
desire for acceptance through the number of likes or
followers one has.
