LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Sugar fear-mongering unhelpful
By The Washington Times Tuesday, June 25, 2013
In his recent piece “Is obesity a disease?”
(Web, June 19), Dr. Peter Lind refers to high-fructose
corn syrup and other “manufactured sugars” as “poison”
that will “guarantee storage of fat in the body.”
Current scientific research strongly indicates that obesity
results from excessive calorie intake combined with a
sedentary lifestyle. The fact is Americans are consuming
more total calories now than ever before. According to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, our total per-capita
daily caloric intake increased by 22 percent from
2,076 calories per day in 1970 to 2,534 calories per day
in 2010 — an additional 458 calories, only 34 of which
come from increased added sugar intake. A vast majority
of these calories come from increased fats and flour/
cereals. Surprisingly, the amount of caloric sweeteners
(i.e. sugar, high-fructose, corn syrup, honey, etc.).
Americans consume has actually decreased over the
past decade. We need to continue to study the obesity
epidemic to see what more can be done, but demonizing
one specific ingredient accomplishes nothing and raises
unnecessary fears that get in the way of real solutions.
